        <h1>2.In my high school life</h1>

        <p>I studied in National Dali Senior High School (NDSH),
        which located in Taichung and now renamed to The Affiliated Senior High School of
        National Chung Hsing University (SHCH). I left home and lived in the school dormitory
        because the school is far from my home. At first, I didn't adapt myself to new condition.
        I remember that I didn't sleep well at that time. Fortunately, I met some roommates to
        help me adapt myself to new life. Finally, I had a good high school life,
        and I met many good friends in my high school life.</p>

        <h1>Baseball</h1>

        <p>Baseball, which is a charming sport, is my interest. I fell in love with baseball
        when I first saw the baseball game in TV.  Baseball is a sport played between two
        teams usually of nine players each. It is a bat-and-ball game in which a pitcher
        throws (pitches) a hard, fist-sized, leather-covered ball toward a batter on the
        opposing team. The batter attempts to hit the baseball with a tapered cylindrical bat, made of wood (as required in professional baseball) or a variety of other materials (as allowed in many nonprofessional games). A team scores runs only when batting, by advancing its players—primarily via hits—counterclockwise past a series of four markers called bases arranged at the corners of a ninety-foot square, or "diamond." The game, played without time restriction, is structured around nine segments called innings. In each inning, both teams are given the opportunity to
        bat and score runs; a team's half-inning ends when three outs are recorded against that
        team.</p>
